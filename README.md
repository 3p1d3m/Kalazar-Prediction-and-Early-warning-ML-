# Declining Kala-azar Cases: Hibernation for Resurgence or Journey towards True Extinction?  Exploring the Impact of Climate, Lankien, Republic of South Sudan. 

The prevalence of Kalazar/Visceral Leishmaniasis cases treated in Lankien hospital has been progressively decreasing, especially since the year 2020. While there was a notable frequent episode of flooding in the area, the reason behind the low number of VL cases remained uninvestigated.

**The possible scenarios could:**

*1) The climate change impact, for example, flooding has buried all the breeding sites of the sandflies.*

*2) The highest temperature has exceeded the previous temperature range, and adult sandflies cannot survive, so the transmission is low*

*3) Has the humidity and land surface temperature changed due to the temperature and flooding, and, hence, affected the Life cycle of Sandflies?*

*4) Kalazar has infected more people, and there is higher community-level immunity; hence, fewer severe cases seek treatment. False prevalence??*

*5) Most severe VL cases are seeking treatment in other facilities, hence false prevalence??*

*6) Has the community’s behaviour and way of living changed? Prevention methods applied? etc?*

**What is available for Lankien?**

*1) Seroprevalence survey?*

*2) Vector prevalence and behaviour study?*

*3) Kalazar and climate study?*

*4) Any other data available*
